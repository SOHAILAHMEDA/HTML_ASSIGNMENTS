<h1>Overview of C language</h1>
<ol>
<li>C language is known as structure-oriented language or procedure-oriented language.</li>
<li>Employs top-down programming approach where a problem is viewed as a sequence of tasks to
be performed.</li>
<li>All program code of c can be executed in C++ but converse many not be possible.</li>
<li>Function overloading and operator overloading are not possible.</li>
<li>Local variables can be declared only at the beginning of the block.</li>
<li>Program controls are through jumps and calls to subroutines.</li>
<li>Polymorphism, encapsulation and inheritance are not possible.</li>
<li>For solving the problems, the problem is divided into a number of modules. Each module is a subprogram.</li>
<li>Data abstraction property is not supported by procedure-oriented language.</li>
<li>Data in procedure-oriented language is open and can be accessed by any function.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Overview of C++ language</h1>
<ol>
<li>C++ can be considered as an incremental version of c language which consists all programming
language constructs with newly added features of object-oriented programming.</li>
<li>C++ is structure(procedure) oriented and object-oriented programming language.</li>
<li>The file extension of C++ program is “.CPP”.</li>
<li>Function overloading and operator overloading are possible.</li>
<li>Variables can be declared in inline i.e when required.</li>
<li>In C++ more emphasis is given on data rather than procedures.</li>
<li>Polymorphism, encapsulation and inheritance are possible.</li>
<li>Data abstraction property is supported by C++.</li>
<li>Data access is limited. It can be accessed by providing various visibility modes both for data
and member functions. there by providing data security by data hiding.</li>
<li>Dynamic binding is supported byC++.</li>
<li>It supports all features of c language.</li>
<li>It can be called as an incremental version of c language.</li>

<h1><u>Principles( or features) of object oriented programming:</u></h1>
<ol>
<li>Encapsulation.</li>
<li>Data abstraction.</li>
<li>Polymorphism.</li>
<li>Inheritance.</li>
<li>Dynamic binding.</li>
<li>Message passing.</li>
</ol>
<dt><b>Encapsulation:</b></dt>
<dd>Wrapping of data and functions together as a single unit is known as encapsulation. By
default data is not accessible to outside world and they are only accessible through the functions which are
wrapped in a class. prevention of data direct access by the program is called data hiding or information
hiding</dd>
<dt><b>Data abstraction:</b></dt>
<dd>Abstraction refers to the act of representing essential features without including the
back ground details or explanation. Classes use the concept of abstraction and are defined as a list of
attributes such as size, weight, cost and functions to operate on these attributes. They encapsulate all
essential properties of the object that are to be created. The attributes are called as data members as they
hold data and the functions which operate on these data are called as member functions.
Class use the concept of data abstraction so they are called <b>abstract data type (ADT)</b></dd>
<dt><b>Polymorphism:</b></dt>
<dd>Polymorphism comes from the Greek words “poly” and “morphism”. “poly” means
many and “morphism” means form i.e.. many forms. Polymorphism means the ability to take more than
one form. For example, an operation have different behavior in different instances. The behavior depends
upon the type of the data used in the operation.
Different ways to achieving polymorphism in C++ program:
1) Function overloading 2) Operator overloading
<br>#include<iostream>
<br>using namespace
<br>std; int main()
<br>{int a=4; a=a<<2;
<br>cout<<”a=”<<a<<endl;
<br>return 0;
<br>}
<br><dt><b>Inheritance:</b></dt> <dd>Inheritance is the process by which one object can acquire the properties of another.</dd>

<br>Inheritance is the most promising concept of OOP, which helps realize the goal of constructing software
from reusable parts, rather than hand coding every system from scratch. Inheritance not only supports
reuse across systems, but also directly facilitates extensibility within a system. Inheritance coupled with
polymorphism and dynamic binding minimizes the amount of existing code to be modified while
enhancing a system.
<br>When the class child, inherits the class parent, the class child is referred to as derived class (sub
class) and the class parent as a base class (super class). In this case, the class child has two parts: a derived
part and an incremental part. The derived part is inherited from the class parent. The incremental part is
the new code written specifically for the class child.
